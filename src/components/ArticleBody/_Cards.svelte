            The Vikings&lsquo; best season and the closest they&lsquo;ve come to
            the Super Bowl since 2000 came with Brett Favre posting one of the
            best years of a Hall of Fame career that included three straight
            MVPs from 1995-97. As a 40-year-old Viking, the ex-Packer had career
            highs in completion percentage (68.4) and passer rating (107.2)
            while throwing a career-low seven interceptions during a fun,
            magical 12-4 ride for the ages right up to that 31-28 overtime loss
            in the NFC title game at the Superdome 16 years ago. Daunte
            Culpepper had a great 2004 season and even helped an 8-8 team upset
            Favre and the Packers in a wild-card game at Lambeau Field that
            year, but with no dominant, no-brainer Vikings QB to choose from
            over the first 25 years of this century, I put Favre on my team
            despite his brief 29-game stint.
